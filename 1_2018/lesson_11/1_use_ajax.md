# Using AJAX

Now you should know:
* AJAX is used to retrieve data from a url
* the data is usually formatted with JSON
* we can just the jquery `$.get()` function to retrieve data from a url and do something with it

YAY! Let get to it.

The goal of this exercise is to use a public API (meaning you don't need any permissions to access the data) to grab data and display it on a web page with jQuery.

## Build A Trivia App With an API

There are a lot of public APIs out there that you can use to build an web application with. For this project, we are going to us a Trivia API, called [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

However, there are A BUNCH of fun APIs out there... If you want to forge your own path ahead, feel free to browse through the below APIs and create you own application!

[Dad Jokes](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api)

[NBA Stats](https://any-api.com/nba_com/nba_com/docs/_teamgamelog/GET)

[Robot Avatars](https://robohash.org/)


Anyways! I spent way too long looking through those... okay. Ready to build something! If you are just going to proceed with the Trivia App... continue below.
