# Computer Setup

Objective: Get your computer ready to code!

There are a couple applications we will be using pretty regularly. Please go ahead and install these.


### Create The Following Accounts

GitHub: https://github.com/


Slack: you should have already received an invitation for the CoderGirl Slack Community via email. Please make sure you accept and setup your account.

Canvas: you should have also logged in and setup this account.



### Download Applications

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)
// TODO: add a little blurb about why Chrome...


[Slack](https://slack.com/downloads/)
I would recommend for your desktop AND/OR phone): https://slack.com/downloads/


[Atom](https://atom.io/)


### Install A Terminal Or Bash Application

For Mac:
    should be good (maybe add test to make sure they have git installed?)

For Windows:

* [Git for Windows](http://gitforwindows.org/)



That should be it for now!
